# innovateHerProject

## What

Our project is a web-based platform designed to provide comprehensive, accessible, and accurate information about reproductive health and rights in the United States. It features an interactive dashboard displaying state-specific abortion laws and exceptions, alongside educational resources on contraceptives, sustainable feminine hygiene options, and hormonal health. By combining a user-friendly interface with reliable data, the platform empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their health and well-being.

## Why

In a time when access to reliable information on reproductive rights is increasingly uncertain, exemplified by the unavailability of https://reproductiverights.gov, this platform aims to fill the gap by offering a centralized, trustworthy resource. It not only addresses the critical need for awareness about state-level legal variations but also promotes sustainable and healthy practices for feminine hygiene and hormonal health. By leveraging technology to simplify complex topics, we strive to support informed decision-making and foster a sense of autonomy for individuals navigating their reproductive health."
